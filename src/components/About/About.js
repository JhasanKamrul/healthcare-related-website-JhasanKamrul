                        <h1>Our Story</h1>
                        <h4>The idea for medcorder came from our founder, David, whose dad Gordon was fighting prostate cancer.</h4>
                        <p>Having already lost his mom to lung cancer, David saw how much information was presented orally in doctor-patient consults, and never repeated. This information was dense, nuanced, and discussed far more quickly than most people can type or write.</p>
                        <p>Consequently Gordon made sure to record all of his medical meetings and email them as an attachment to David, who would manually transcribe them, summarize them, and explain technical terms like medications, conditions, or procedures.</p>
                        <p>This was super helpful for keeping the family in the loop but was also a huge amount of work. David saw that an app could be built to make this process easy for anyone facing any complex medical condition, so he began working on the first version of medcorder in late 2018.</p>
